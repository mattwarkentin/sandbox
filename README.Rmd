This is a personal repository. It contains a variety of miscellaneous `R` functions, many of which are poorly maintained or under heavy development.

When too many functions with a common theme build up, they will likely be decoupled into their own package. This repo is liable to change drastically without notice.

__Use functions at your own risk!__ 

Please feel free to contibrute code via a pull request, or post an issue if you would like something added or changed.
