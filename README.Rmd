# Information

**Author:** Matthew T. Warketin, MSc. Ph.D (c)

**Email:** <warkentin@lunenfeld.ca>

This is a personal repository. It contains a variety of miscellaneous `R` functions, many of which are poorly maintained or under heavy development.

When too many functions with a common theme build up, they will likely be decoupled into their own `R` package. This repo is liable to change drastically without notice.

__Use functions at your own risk!__ 

Please feel free to contribute code via a [pull request](https://github.com/mattwarkentin/sandbox/pulls), or post an [issue](https://github.com/mattwarkentin/sandbox/issues) if you would like to request a feature or if you need help troubleshooting an issue.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mattwarkentin/sandbox")
```

## Code of Conduct

Please note that the 'sandbox' project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
