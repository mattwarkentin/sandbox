This is a personal repository. It contains a variety of miscellaneous
`R` functions, many of which are poorly maintained or under heavy
development.

When too many functions with a common theme build up, they will likely
be decoupled into their own package. This repo is liable to change
drastically without notice.

**Use functions at your own risk\!**

Please feel free to contibrute code via a pull request, or post an issue
if you would like something added or changed.
