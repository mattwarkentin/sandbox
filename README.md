This is some text to describe my sandbox repo. This repo contains my dev code for miscellaneous functions that I write in R and have documented as a R package.

Here is some of the important functions in this package:

-   Best ROC Thresholds
    -   `indexOfUnion`
    -   `youden`
    -   `topleft`
    -   `minPVal`
    -   `conc_prob`
-   Competing Risk calibration metrics
    -   `calibrate`
