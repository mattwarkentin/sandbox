# Information

This is a personal repository. It contains a variety of miscellaneous
`R` functions, many of which are poorly maintained or under heavy
development.

When too many functions with a common theme build up, they will likely
be decoupled into their own package. This repo is liable to change
drastically without notice.

**Use functions at your own risk\!**

Please feel free to contribute code via a [pull
request](https://github.com/mattwarkentin/sandbox/pulls), or post an
[issue](https://github.com/mattwarkentin/sandbox/issues) if you would
like to request a feature or if you need help troubleshooting an issue.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mattwarkentin/sandbox")
```
