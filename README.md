This is my personal repository. It contains a variety of miscellaneous
functions, many of which are poorly maintained or under heavy
development.

When too many functions with a common theme build up, they will likely
be decoupled into their own package. This repo is liable to change
drastically.

Use funtions at your own risk. Please feel free to contibrute code or
post an issue.
